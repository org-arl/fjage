**Framework for Java and Groovy Agents**

version 1.0  
developed by [Mandar Chitre](http://www.chitre.net), [Acoustic Research Laboratory](http://www.arl.nus.edu.sg)

Introduction
------------

fjåge provides a framework for [agent-oriented software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-oriented_programming) in Java and Groovy. Although most of the functionality of the framework can be used in pure-Java projects, the adoption of Groovy in the project simplifies development immensely. Typically, initialization scripts, shell interaction and command scripts are written in Groovy. Agents and support classes may be written in Java or Groovy.
